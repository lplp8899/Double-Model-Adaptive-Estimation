# Double-Model-Adaptive-Estimation

This is the code for the following journal paper:
P. Lu, E. van Kampen, C. C. de Visser, Q. P. Chu
Framework for state and unknown input estimation of linear time-varying systems
Automatica, 2016(73), 145-154


# Usage

## 1. you can generate the data in three scanerios by running the following program:
generate_sys_data.m

## 2. Then you can perform the fault estimation by running the following program:
DMAE_fault_state_disturbance_estimation.m

## You can also directly run this program since the generated data have already been included.
